This version is my analysis code to do the pi0-calibration of the EMCal.

Keeping this is important for me if my analysis codes gets lost in the rcas environments. I will explain how the analysis worksbelow. The detail will be in the separate pdf files, although. I have now attached the pdf file (EMCal tower-by-tower) into this area. That is the presentation I gave into the sPHENIX calo calibration meeting.
